Welcome! I am currently a postdoc in the Division of Decision and Control Systems at KTH, Sweden, under the supervision of Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson. Before that, I got my Ph.D. at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Jinming Xu and Prof. Jiming Chen. My research interests include distributed/federated optimization, large-scale machine learning, and differentially private computing.
